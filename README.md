# Horus
## The keeper of the keys

Horus is a simple, terminal-based password manager and 2FA generator. 
Instead of saving passwords, Horus generates passwords using MD5 hashing of the account name and secret seed phrase and copies it directly to the clipboard.

It has 2 functions:
* Generate passwords based on the account name and seed phrase
* Generate 2FA codes
